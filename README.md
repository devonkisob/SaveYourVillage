# SaveYourVillage

SaveYourVillage is a Text-Based Adventure game that I created in Java. It's the first game I have ever created by myself. In the game you are a Wizard and your village is being terrorized by a Dragon. The Dragon and its fellow animal predators roam the forest and you're the only one that can stop them. Enjoy and go save your village!
